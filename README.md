## Overview
This repository contains scripts that reproduce results in the manuscript "Bond graph modelling of the cardiac action potential: Implications for drift and non-unique steady states" (http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2018.0106).

## MATLAB
The MATLAB directory contains scripts that reproduce the figures in the manuscript. The script `MATLAB/code/main_script.m` will generate all figures when run.

## CellML
The CellML directory contains a CellML model for each variant of the cardiac action potential model.

## BG
The BG directory contains PostScript and PDF files of the bond graph structures. The .fig files can be viewed and edited using the Xfig graphics editor.
