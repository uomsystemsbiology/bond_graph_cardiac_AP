## Overview
This repository contains scripts that reproduce results in the manuscript "Conserved moieties determine long-term behaviour of the cardiac action potential: The general analysis of a bond graph model".

## MATLAB
The MATLAB directory contains scripts that reproduce the figures in the manuscript. The `main_script.m` file will generate all figures when run.

## CellML
The CellML directory contains a CellML model for each variant of the cardiac action potential model.

## BG
The BG directory contains PostScript and PDF files of the bond graph structures. The .fig files can be viewed and edited using the Xfig graphics editor.
